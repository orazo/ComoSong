1
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:35,413
Imagine there′s no heaven

2
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:42,200
It is easy if you try

3
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:49,413
No hell below us

4
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:55,402
Above us only sky

5
00:00:55,616 --> 00:01:06,715
Imagine all the people
living for today

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:15,710
Imagine there′s no countries

7
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:22,507
It isn′t hard to do

8
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:28,914
Nothing to kill or die for

9
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:35,301
And no religion too

10
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:48,208
Imagine all the people living
life in peace‚ you

11
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:55,807
You may say I am a dreamer

12
00:01:56,007 --> 00:02:02,006
But I am not the only one

13
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:08,811
I hope some day you′ll join us

14
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:15,404
And the world will be as one

15
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:21,917
Imagine no possessions

16
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:28,308
I wonder if you can

17
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:34,715
No need for greed or hunger

18
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:41,410
A brotherhood of man

19
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:55,209
Imagine all the people sharing
all the world‚ you

20
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,898
You may say I am a dreamer

21
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:08,207
But I am not the only one

22
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:15,710
I hope some day you′ll join us

23
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,909
And the world will be as one

24
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:30,910
